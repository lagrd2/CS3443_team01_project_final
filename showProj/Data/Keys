Keys for files
Transaction files (.trns)
	Transaction ID:Client ID:Product ID:Amount Sold:Payment Method
Customer Files (.cust)
	Customer ID:Firstname:Lastname:Phone:Email:Address:City:Zipcode
Product Files (.prod)
	Product ID:Product Name:Product Description:Vendor Cost:Sale Price:UPC

Short math explanation:
When calculating a transaction, the program should look at the transaction file (or data structure) for the Product ID and Amount Sold.
It should then look to the Product file (or structure) for the corresponding Product for the Sale Price. 
With this information the program can calculate the totals of all sales. 
Other: The total profit can be calculated as well.

Thoughts: This method of doing things may be seen as incorrect. More information may need to be stored in the .trns file concerning the sale.
Say the price of Apples changes, then all previous transactions would reflect incorrectly.
