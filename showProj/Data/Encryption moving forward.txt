I think the best way to move forward with the encryption (once it is figured out...) is to store all users
in a separate text file. Reason being: if we do move to a multi-user environment, we would have to recreate the 
user authentication system, as the customer file would be encrypted with a particular user's password. 

We may need to consult the group on this, but I think that the following model might make life easier on us. 
AuthenticatedUsers.txt format:
UserName,Password,FilesWithAccessTo,AuthLevel
UserName2,Password,FilesWithAccessTo,Authlevel


[Key]
!!!!!ENCRYPTION KEY FOR FILE1!!!!
!!!!!ENCRYPTION KEY FOR FILE2!!!!
[/KEY]


This file can be encrypted with a simple encryption (+5) or whatnot.
If a user authenticates correctly, it un-encrypts the specified file (If the user has access to it) with a 
sudo(or fully) random key which is created by the program when the file is created. 

Granted this is not the most secure solution, but it seems to me that it would function well enough for us. 
This could still be merged with the customer file itself, but I feel like having two separate files would be easier
to manage. 

I would like the group's input on this, and will create an issue in github with this information.
